## 🧠 Database Index Strategy

This application uses a unique index on email field in the database to guarantee no duplicate users can register.  
An error is caught on the backend and displayed on the UI accordingly.

> 📌 If using a storage that doesn't support indices, an alternative strategy using email as key, triggers, or similar consistency-enforcing methods is applied.
